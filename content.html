          <h3>Hobbies </h3>
          <ul>
            <li><span>Plan and Organize:</span> When I am bored, I tend to find myself planning random things and organizing it.
              For example, when I have a lot of tasks I have to do, I like to plan and organize exactly when I should do
              certain tasks on what day and what time. This is because I hate the feeling of being late or not being able
              to finish something on time.</li>
            <li><span>Origami:</span> To relax, I like to make random paper foldings. </li>
            <li><span>Teamwork activities:</span> Sometimes during my free time, my friends and I will play games together,
            usually ones that strongly depend on teamwork. This helps me be more social and gain teamwork skills while
            having fun with friends. </li>
            <li><span>Design:</span> Every once in a while, I like to design random stuff. It is different every month. For example, I'll
            design houses, rooms, and websites using paper or/and programs.</li>
            <li><span>Helping People:</span> I love to help people. I enjoy tutoring people when I know for sure I can be helpful.
            I also love to troubleshoot computer problems. Whenever my friends have issues with their computer, they tend to
            reach out to me. When I notice someone struggling with their code, I will try to help them if I believe I can.</li>
